# go-autobackup
Utility application to automatically zip and save backups periodically.

Usage: ./go-autobackup.exe \<file/directory to backup\> \<path to save to\> \<frequency in minutes\>

WARNING: This has only been tested for my personal use cases. Always backup your files manually too!

WARNING: I think this currently breaks the local Git repos.
